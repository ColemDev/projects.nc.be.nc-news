How to craft a useful, well-written README

Here’s the list, in order, of elements you should have in your README.

A strong H1 title and an H2 subtitle - Just like writing an article or a blog post, you need a great title and subtitle to attract search engines and humans. It doesn’t need to be the name of your project, but it does help if your title includes the name of the project.

An intro paragraph focused on what the project does -
Write an intro paragraph about:

- what this project is,
- what it does,
- and how it’s used.

This section is still for SEO purposes and for keeping it simple about the value your project provides to the user who is searching for it.

Installation and usage instructions (for end-users) - Now it’s time to get a little bit nerdier. If a user has gotten this far into your README, you bet there’s a chance they actually want to use your project.

Give instructions on how to install or use the tool.
This section should only talk about how to be a consumer of the project.
